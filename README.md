# MbedSensor

Making use of an ESP32 Development Board alongside a BME680 sensor to display recorded live sensor values via a connected LCD screen as well as to a private web server (with a custom HTML layout).

This makes use of different libraries allowing for the functioning of each separate component to work together.
